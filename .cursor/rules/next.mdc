- You are an expert in TypeScript, Node.js, Next.js App Router, React, Shadcn UI, and Tailwind and Framer Motion.

- General

- When generating code, prioritize TypeScript and React best practices.
- Ensure that any new components are reusable and follow the existing design patterns.
- Minimize the use of AI generated comments, instead use clearly named variables and functions.
- Always validate user inputs and handle errors gracefully.
- Use the existing components and pages as a reference for the new components and pages.

- Code Style and Structure

  - Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
  - Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
  - Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
  - Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
  - Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.

- Naming Conventions

  - All components should go in src/components and be named like new-component.tsx
  - Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
  - Favor named exports for components.

- TypeScript Usage

  - Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
  - Avoid enums; use maps instead.
  - Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.

- Syntax and Formatting

  - Use the "function" keyword for pure functions.
  - Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
  - Use declarative JSX.

- UI and Styling

  - Use Shadcn UI, and Tailwind for components and styling.
  - Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach.

- Performance Optimization

  - Minimize 'use client', 'useEffect', and 'setState'; favor React Server Components (RSC).
  - Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback.
  - Use dynamic loading for non-critical components.
  - Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading.

- Key Conventions

  - Use 'nuqs' for URL search parameter state management.
  - Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID).
  - Limit 'use client':
    - Favor server components and Next.js SSR.
    - Use only for Web API access in small components.
    - Avoid for data fetching or state management.
  - Follow Next.js docs for Data Fetching, Rendering, and Routing.
  - While creating placeholder images as a part of your seed data, use https://placekitten.com/
  - Place both the /app and /components folders under a /src directory. This organization offers several benefits:
    - It helps maintain a clean and organized project structure.
    - It allows for easier navigation and management of components and pages.
    - It adheres to common industry standards, making it easier for other developers to understand and contribute to the project.
    - It provides a clear separation between application logic (in /src/app) and UI components (in /src/components), improving code readability and reusability.
    - It simplifies the process of creating new pages and components, as you can easily find the corresponding files in the /src directory.
    - It makes the project more modular and easier to scale as the application grows.
    - It adheres to the principle of separation of concerns, where different aspects of the application are handled by different directories.

## Components Organization

Within the /src/components folder, consider organizing components by type or feature:

By Type: Group components like forms, buttons, layout elements, etc.

By Feature: For larger applications, group components related to specific features or domains

For example:

/src/components
├── /ui
│ ├── /Button
│ ├── /Modal
│ └── /Card
├── /forms
│ ├── /TextField
│ └── /Select
└── /layout
├── /Navbar
└── /Footer

- Private Components: For components used only within specific pages, you can create a \_components folder within the relevant /app subdirectory.

- Shared Components: The /src/components folder should contain reusable components used across multiple pages or features.

- Modular Approach: As your project grows, consider adopting a more modular structure, where each feature or domain has its own folder containing components, hooks, and utilities specific to that feature.
